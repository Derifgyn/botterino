    download windows terminal from the microsoft store:
        https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1

colors should work out of the box on other platforms 

Use botterino on a round that is already live:
    in the case that 

    1. you post manually and decide you would like bot to host 
    2. bot posts for you but crashes during hosting 

    you will want to use failure.py 

    usage:
    edit answer and tolerance in failure.py
    run with: python failure.py

Disable checking for updates:
    if the prompt for updating annoys you, add the following line to praw.ini:
    donotupdate=true
